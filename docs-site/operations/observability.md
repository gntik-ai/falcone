# Observability

In Falcone ships a Prometheus-based observability stack (chart alias `observability`) and surfaces per-tenant signals in the console's **Observability** and **Operations** views.

## What's collected

| Signal | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Platform metrics** | Service health, request rates, latencies |
| **Usage / consumption** | Per-tenant resource usage (drives quotas & billing inputs) |
| **Quota / limit signals** | Threshold alerts, hard-limit enforcement decisions |
| **Audit pipeline** | Query-safe audit records for governed actions (e.g. function lifecycle) |
| **Business metrics** | Higher-level platform KPIs |

The repository enforces the schema and presence of these via `npm run validate:observability-*` checks (metrics stack, dashboards, health checks, business metrics, usage/consumption, quota policies, threshold alerts, hard-limit enforcement, console alerts, audit pipeline/event-schema/query/export/correlation surfaces).

## Per-tenant visibility

Metrics, usage and audit are **tenant-keyed**, so the console can show one tenant's consumption and operations without exposing another's. Operations records (with detail views) track governed actions and their outcomes.

## Quotas & hard limits

A plan's `quota_policy` defines enforced limits and overage behaviour ([Domain Model](/architecture/domain-model#plans-quotas-entitlements)). The observability stack raises **threshold alerts** as usage approaches a limit and records **hard-limit enforcement** decisions when a limit is hit — both visible in the console's Quotas view.

## Health checks

Each component exposes health/readiness endpoints; `helm upgrade --install` gates on rollout completion. After install:

```bash
kubectl -n falcone rollout status deploy --timeout=300s
kubectl -n falcone get pods
```

## Audit

Governed operations (function deployments, admin actions, rollbacks, quota enforcement) produce **query-safe audit records** (`domain-model.json`), retained for compliance and surfaced through the audit query/export/correlation surfaces.

## Flows & MCP signals *(Preview)*

The AI-native capabilities are first-class in the same stack:

- **Flows** — Temporal execution health plus the flow lifecycle audit topic (`FLOW_AUDIT_TOPIC`); per-tenant flow quotas are enforced through the same quota machinery.
- **MCP** — `mcp` is a first-class **audit subsystem** (per-OAuth-client governance events), tenant-scoped and queryable in the console; per-tool-call usage rides the `in_falcone_mcp_tool_invocations_total` metric (business domain `mcp_tool_usage`) with latency on the normalized component-latency family, and the `mcp_tool_invocations` quota dimension surfaces in the per-tenant quota posture. All of these are covered by the `validate:observability-*` checks above. See [MCP Architecture](/architecture/mcp).
