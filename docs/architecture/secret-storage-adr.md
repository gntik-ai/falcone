# ADR: Secure secret storage with Vault + ESO

- Date: 2026-03-30
- Status: Accepted

## Context
Plaintext cluster credentials create unacceptable operational and security risk.

## Decision
Use Vault OSS as the source of truth and External Secrets Operator to synchronize Kubernetes Secrets.

## Alternatives considered
- Sealed Secrets
- Kubernetes native Secrets only
- AWS Secrets Manager

## Consequences
- Improved auditability and domain isolation.
- Added operational responsibility for Vault bootstrap, TLS, and unseal workflows.
