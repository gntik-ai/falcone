## The principle behind Falcone

Most products need the same backend plumbing: a database, file storage, user
authentication, background jobs, an event bus, realtime updates. Building and
operating that plumbing **once per application — and again for every customer —**
is where teams lose time and where security incidents are born.

Falcone exists to solve that once. It is a **multitenant BaaS**: a single
platform that serves many isolated tenants, each with their own data, identities
and resources, exposed through one consistent API.

Two ideas hold the whole system together:

1. **Tenant isolation is the contract, not a feature.**
   Every read and every write is scoped by `tenant_id` (and, one level down, by
   `workspace_id`). Identity is resolved at the edge from a token, propagated as
   an explicit context through the gateway, services, the data layer and
   background jobs, and enforced at the database with row-level security and
   per-tenant schemas. Cross-tenant leakage is treated as the cardinal bug.

2. **Capabilities are granted by plan, enforced everywhere.**
   What a tenant can do — SQL, realtime, webhooks, functions, Kafka, storage — is
   the intersection of its **commercial plan**, the **deployment profile** and the
   **environment**. The gateway gates routes on those capability keys, quotas cap
   consumption per tenant/workspace, and every denial is audited.

The result is a platform where a customer gets a full backend in minutes, and the
operator keeps a single, governable, observable surface — instead of a fleet of
hand-rolled backends.

### How it fits together

## Built for AI: a BaAIS

Falcone begins where any backend platform does — multitenant data, auth, storage, events and
functions behind one API — and aims it at how software is increasingly built and operated:
**by, and for, AI agents.**

We call this category a **BaAIS** — a *Backend-as-an-AI-Service*, a play on "BaaS" for an
AI-native world. (The expansion is intentionally loose; what matters is the direction, not the
acronym.) Concretely, "built for AI" means a tenant's backend is designed to be **natively
consumable by agents**, not only by application code:

- **MCP server hosting** *(Preview)* — a tenant exposes its backend (data, storage, functions) as a
  [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so any MCP-capable agent can
  discover and call it under that tenant's own isolation, auth and quotas. The management API is
  served live under `/v1/mcp`; Instant MCP and the official server work end-to-end.
- **Agentic workflows** *(Preview)* — the Temporal-based **Flows** engine lets tenants define
  durable, multi-step workflows from a JSON-Schema DSL, with a first-party activity catalog whose
  credentials are tenant-scoped — the reliable substrate an agent needs to act across services.

Everything an agent touches stays inside the same contract as the rest of the platform: scoped by
tenant and workspace, gated by plan capabilities, and audited.

---

## Roadmap

Falcone is pre-1.0 and moving quickly; this is near-term direction, not a commitment.

**Shipped (Preview).** Both flagship AI-native capabilities have landed and are documented; they
remain Preview under the not-production-ready posture above:

- **MCP server hosting** — the management API is served live under `/v1/mcp`; **Instant MCP** and
  the **official server** work end-to-end (create → curate → publish → call → observe), with
  per-tenant isolation, OAuth, quotas, registry/versioning and audit. Server state is in-memory
  (single-replica) today. ([epic #386](https://github.com/gntik-ai/falcone/issues/386))
- **Flows — durable workflow engine (Temporal)** — tenant-defined workflows via a JSON-Schema DSL
  and interpreter worker, a first-party activity catalog with tenant-scoped credentials, triggers
  and a visual designer. ([epic #355](https://github.com/gntik-ai/falcone/issues/355))

**In progress / planned.**

- **MCP next increments** — a durable (Postgres-backed) multi-replica server registry; custom
  (bring-your-own-image) hosting on the live create path; wiring workflows-as-MCP-tools; and a
  direct per-server MCP-protocol connection (the control-plane mediates tool calls today).
- **Object storage — MinIO → SeaweedFS (complete).** **SeaweedFS** (Apache-2.0) is the object
  store ([ADR-13](docs-site/architecture/adrs.md)), deployed by the umbrella chart and enabled by
  default; the former MinIO `storage` component has been removed. See the
  [SeaweedFS Storage Runbook](docs-site/architecture/seaweedfs.md).
- **Document store — MongoDB → FerretDB + DocumentDB (complete).** **FerretDB v2** (Apache-2.0,
  MongoDB-wire-compatible) over a **DocumentDB / PostgreSQL** engine (MIT) is the document store
  ([ADR-14](docs-site/architecture/adrs.md#adr-14-migrate-document-store-from-mongodb-to-ferretdb-v2-documentdb)),
  deployed by the umbrella chart; the former MongoDB server component has been removed. The MongoDB
  driver, wire protocol and Mongo-style data API are unchanged. See the
  [FerretDB Document-Store Runbook](docs-site/architecture/ferretdb.md).
- **Toward a first stable release** — *planned.* Security review, API/schema stability guarantees,
  and migration tooling (see the notice at the top).

## Capabilities

| Domain | What it gives a tenant |
| --- | --- |
| **Tenant lifecycle** | Create, suspend, soft-delete and purge tenants through a guarded state machine (`draft → provisioning → active → suspended → soft_deleted`), with governance dashboards and dual-confirmation on destructive actions. |
| **Provisioning saga** | Asynchronous orchestration that stands up (or tears down) a tenant across every domain — IAM realm, Kafka namespace, Postgres schema, document store (FerretDB/DocumentDB), storage namespace, functions namespace — with preflight checks and rollback on failure. |
| **Workspaces** | Sub-tenant boundaries with their own slug, environment, IAM scope and membership. Clone workspaces with explicit policies; resolve shared vs. specialized resource inheritance. |
| **Authentication & IAM** | OIDC-delegated console login, signup with pending-activation, password recovery. Keycloak realm-per-tenant administration of realms, clients, roles, scopes and users. JWT validation via cached JWKS with introspection fallback. |
| **Service accounts & OAuth2 apps** | Per-workspace OAuth2 clients and API-key service accounts with HTTPS redirect-URI validation and plan-enforced limits. |
| **PostgreSQL** | Tenant-scoped data API plus admin/governance, change-data-capture, metrics and audit. Isolation by row-level security (`app.tenant_id` / `app.workspace_id`) and per-tenant schemas. |
| **Document store (FerretDB + DocumentDB)** | Per-tenant/workspace document data API, admin, realtime/CDC (Postgres logical replication), metrics and audit. MongoDB-wire-compatible; replaces MongoDB (ADR-14). |
| **Object storage** | S3-compatible buckets, multipart uploads, presigned URLs, access policies, event notifications and per-tenant capacity quotas. |
| **Events (Kafka)** | Topic management and tenant-scoped CDC streams (`<prefix>.<tenant>.<workspace>`) fed by PostgreSQL logical replication, plus system audit/quota/lifecycle topics. |
| **Realtime** | WebSocket subscriptions (`/v1/websockets`) with Bearer-JWT auth, scope-to-channel enforcement and per-session tenant isolation. |
| **Functions** | Serverless functions with versions, activations, invocations, rollback and cron / Kafka / storage triggers. |
| **Webhooks** | Signed, retried webhook delivery with SSRF guarding (private, loopback, link-local and ULA ranges blocked, re-checked at delivery time). |
| **Scheduling** | Cron jobs with per-workspace concurrency and job-count quotas and full execution audit. |
| **Flows (workflow engine)** | Tenant-defined durable workflows on a Temporal-based engine: a JSON-Schema DSL and interpreter worker, a first-party activity catalog with tenant-scoped credentials, triggers (schedules, webhooks, platform events) and a visual designer in the console. *Preview ([epic #355](https://github.com/gntik-ai/falcone/issues/355)).* |
| **MCP server hosting** | Host tenant Model Context Protocol servers so AI agents can call the backend as tools. Management API served live under `/v1/mcp`: Instant MCP (tools generated from a resource), the official read-first server, mandatory curation, registry/versioning with rug-pull review, OAuth 2.1, per-tenant quotas/rate-limits and audit. *Preview — Instant MCP + official server live (in-memory state); custom-image hosting and workflows-as-tools are experimental ([epic #386](https://github.com/gntik-ai/falcone/issues/386)).* |
| **Plans & quotas** | Commercial plans map to capability keys, quota defaults and a deployment profile. Quotas enforce hard-block / soft-grace / soft-exhausted modes per tenant and workspace. |
| **Backup & restore** | Snapshot listing, restore orchestration and point-in-time-recovery simulation over S3 / Postgres / Mongo adapters. |
| **Observability & audit** | Per-tenant audit pipeline (actor, scope envelope, resource, action, result) streamed to Kafka and persisted, with metrics families, health checks, dashboards and threshold alerts. |
| **API gateway** | Single public surface at `/v1` with required idempotency keys, correlation IDs, request validation and per-route timeouts/retries. |
| **Web console** | React + Vite admin UI for tenants, workspaces, members, databases, storage, functions, events, plans, quotas and observability. |

## QuickStart with Docker Compose

The repository ships a Compose stack that brings up the **real backing services**
Falcone talks to — PostgreSQL, Keycloak, Redpanda (Kafka), FerretDB + DocumentDB
(MongoDB-wire document store), SeaweedFS (S3) and OpenBao — plus an APISIX gateway and an action runner.
This is the fastest way to get a working environment on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Docker with the Compose plugin (`docker compose`)
- Node.js 20+ and `pnpm` (via `corepack enable`) — only needed to run the suites

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gntik-ai/falcone.git
cd falcone
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

### 2. Bring up the stack with Docker Compose

The helper script wires up health checks, migrations, the FerretDB + DocumentDB document store, the
SeaweedFS bucket and the OpenBao audit device for you:

```bash
cd tests/env
./up.sh
```

…or drive Compose directly if you only want the containers:

```bash
docker compose -f tests/env/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
docker compose -f tests/env/docker-compose.yml ps
```

### 3. Services and ports

| Service | URL / endpoint | Credentials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API gateway (APISIX) | <http://localhost:9080> | Bearer JWT from Keycloak |
| Keycloak (IdP) | <http://localhost:8081> | `admin` / `admin` |
| PostgreSQL | `localhost:55432` | `falcone` / `falcone` |
| FerretDB gateway (MongoDB wire) | `localhost:57017` | `falcone` / `falcone` |
| Redpanda (Kafka) | `localhost:19092` | — |
| SeaweedFS (S3 API) | <http://localhost:58333> | S3 access/secret key (path-style) |
| OpenBao (dev) | <http://localhost:58200> | token `root` |

### 4. Exercise it

```bash
# Run the unit / contract / e2e suites against the live stack
pnpm test

# or the public-interface black-box contract suite
bash tests/blackbox/run.sh
```

### 5. Tear it down

```bash
cd tests/env
./down.sh
# or: docker compose -f tests/env/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

> For a full production-grade deployment (functions runtime, the control-plane and
> the web console), use the Helm charts under `helm/` and `charts/` on a Kubernetes
> cluster — see the manifests in `deploy/`.
