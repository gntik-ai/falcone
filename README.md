# In Falcone

**In Falcone** is a self-hosted, multi-tenant Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that provides managed databases, identity, serverless functions, event streaming, and object storage — all deployed on your own Kubernetes or OpenShift infrastructure via a single Helm chart.

It organizes resources in a hierarchical model — platform, tenants, workspaces — with built-in plan governance, quota enforcement, and contextual authorization. Each workspace gets isolated PostgreSQL schemas (with RLS), MongoDB databases, Kafka topics, OpenWhisk namespaces, and S3 bucket paths, all provisioned automatically through an idempotent orchestration engine.

The platform ships with an APISIX API gateway (OIDC auth, rate limiting, idempotency, CORS), a Keycloak-based IAM layer with per-tenant realms, a React management console, realtime WebSocket subscriptions backed by CDC bridges, a full audit pipeline with correlation tracking, and Vault-based secret management via External Secrets Operator.

Deployment is declarative and layered: choose a profile (all-in-one, standard, HA), an environment (dev, staging, prod), and a platform target (Kubernetes, OpenShift, air-gapped) — compose them as Helm value overlays and deploy.

## Repository Structure

This repository establishes the working structure for:

- `apps/control-plane`: control plane backend surface
- `apps/web-console`: web console frontend surface
- `services/gateway-config`: gateway and runtime configuration assets, including the unified public API family routing manifest
- `services/internal-contracts`: internal service-map, authorization, deployment-topology, core-domain, and public-API taxonomy baselines
- `services/provisioning-orchestrator`: control-plane orchestration workspace
- `services/audit`: audit/evidence workspace
- `services/adapters`: external service adapter packages
- `charts/in-falcone`: umbrella Helm chart with aliased component wrappers plus layered values for Kubernetes/OpenShift deployments
- `docs`: architecture and working conventions
- `tests/e2e`: end-to-end test workspace
- `tests/reference`: reusable testing strategy package and synthetic reference dataset
- `.specify`: Spec Kit context and project conventions

## Working conventions

- Use `pnpm` workspaces from the repository root.
- Keep deployable applications under `apps/`.
- Keep reusable service-side packages and operational assets under `services/`.
- Keep documentation under `docs/` and decisions under `docs/adr/`.
- Keep environment-specific deployment values outside chart templates when possible.
- Layer deployment values as `common -> environment -> customer -> platform -> airgap -> localOverride -> secretRefs` to make promotion and rollback auditable.
- Keep OpenShift compatibility by avoiding privileged defaults and using standard Kubernetes APIs.

## Quality gates

The current baseline quality chain covers:

- repository structure validation
- PostgreSQL ADR package validation
- testing-strategy package validation
- internal service-map validation
- public-API taxonomy, route-catalog, family-contract, and gateway-routing validation
- deployment-topology validation for domains, environments, overlays, smoke parity, and bootstrap policy
- deployment-chart validation for umbrella dependencies, wrapper coverage, values layers, and bootstrap controller contracts
- authorization-model validation for tenant/workspace context, permission matrices, and propagation targets
- domain-model validation for canonical entities, lifecycle events, OpenAPI mapping, and seed fixtures
- markdown linting
- OpenAPI validation for the unified control-plane/public-gateway contract
- unit tests for helper logic and strategy consistency
- adapter-integration scaffold tests
- contract tests for API versioning/error expectations
- internal contract/service-map tests
- console E2E scaffold tests
- deployment smoke scaffold tests for Kubernetes/OpenShift parity
- resilience scaffold tests
- dependency vulnerability audit
- immutable image-reference policy checks
