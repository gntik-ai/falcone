## Source repository

- [x] Point kind route 2006 at the executor with the host-scoped verifier schema and preserve route 2006-key.
- [x] Require `issuer-jwks-auth` for public-api-mongo in the gateway-policy package and contract while other product routes retain `openid-connect`.
- [x] Cover route policy, chart/kind parity, kind pod wiring, executor workspace rejection, and a live kind bearer document round trip.
- [x] Record the revised operator decision and a requirements delta.
- [x] Require chart/kind route parity in normal PR CI, trigger the live kind gate for authentication test changes, and cover rejected policy regressions and signed tenant-realm identity derivation.

## Deployment repository and release gates

- [x] Complete the host-scoped APISIX verifier with realm validation, platform-only audience enforcement, bounded JWKS cache, fetch load protection, and failure-path Lua tests.
- [x] Render route 2006 and executor issuer/JWKS settings from environment values; verify staging and prod renders contain no dev issuer.
- [x] Mount the verifier Lua file and APISIX config overlay in kind; pass the source kind pod wiring test.
- [x] Render the staging standalone ConfigMap from canonical routes and compare it with a recorded live baseline plus the #980 delta.
- [ ] Run the chart render-equality and Lua verifier tests in PR CI, and pass the staging numeric-user and repair-gate contracts.
- [ ] Run the kind bearer round trip through public APISIX, including unauthenticated and foreign-issuer 401 checks.
- [ ] Record the live staging ConfigMap SHA256, review the diff, then perform the operator-gated sync and post-rollout verification, including APISIX metrics and a second executor-served data-plane family.

## Source worktree validation handoff

Route/parity checks (4), executor JWT verifier tests (9), and deployment Mongo chart render checks (6) pass against the pinned charts revision. Workflow YAML, JavaScript syntax, and diff whitespace checks pass. Gateway-policy unit/contract checks need installed repository dependencies (`yaml` is absent); executor server identity checks need loopback sockets (`listen EPERM` here). Lua verifier checks need Lua, and the live kind round trip needs the CI cluster and disposable client. These checks remain required in PR CI and the release gate.
